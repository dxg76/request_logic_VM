This plaintext serves as Developer notes for the termios struct

tcflag_t c_iflag;      /* input modes */
tcflag_t c_oflag;      /* output modes */
tcflag_t c_cflag;      /* control modes */
tcflag_t c_lflag;      /* local modes */
cc_t     c_cc[NCCS];   /* special characters */

c_cflag = termios control flags:
    Baud Rate
    Character size (number of data bits)
    Parity enabling
    Stop bits
    Flow Control

c_iflag = termios input flags:
    Break condition handling: break conditon occurs when no data is transmitted for multiple characters intentionally
    signaling an interrupt
    Parity error handling
    Canonical mode processing
    Software flow control

c_lflag: local terminal flags

    canonical processing: Terminal waits for user to hit enter before processing input. 
    when disabled each character is available as soon as its transmitted

    Echo: input is not re-output in the terminal

    Signal generation: special  keys send signals ex:(Ctrl^C terminating process)

c_oflag: output flags
    Key remapping: maps certain keys such as linking newline to carriage return
    Delays - self explanatory

cc_t: special character array with symbolic indices
    vmin: minimum nuber of characters necessary for non-canoncial read()
    vtime: timeout in dewciseconds for read()
