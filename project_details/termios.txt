This plaintext serves as Developer notes for the termios struct

tcflag_t c_iflag;      /* input modes */
tcflag_t c_oflag;      /* output modes */
tcflag_t c_cflag;      /* control modes */
tcflag_t c_lflag;      /* local modes */
cc_t     c_cc[NCCS];   /* special characters */

c_cflag = termios control flags:
    Baud Rate
    Character size (number of data bits)
    Parity enabling: parity checking odd even or none,
        provide data security by checking if the number of 1s reflects the parity
    Stop bits: number of bits that terminate transmission
    Hardware Flow Control: 
        CLOCAL disables modem controls basically causes the system to act like there is no modem
        CREAD enables the receiver to read
        CRTSCTS: control for RTS(request to send), and CTS(clear to send) hardware flow control options

c_iflag = termios input flags:
    Break condition handling: break conditon occurs when no data is transmitted for multiple characters intentionally
        signaling an interrupt
    Parity error handling
    Canonical mode processing
    Software flow control: XON an XOFF pass control characters to ensure input flow does not overwhelm receiver. Adds overhead
        IXANY allows any key to restart stopped output instead of the default (Enter Key only)

c_lflag: local terminal flags

    canonical processing: Terminal waits for user to hit enter before processing input. 
        when disabled each character is available as soon as its transmitted

    Echo: input is not re-output in the terminal

    Signal generation: special  keys send signals ex:(Ctrl^C terminating process)

c_oflag: output flags
    Key remapping: maps certain keys such as linking newline to carriage return
    Delays - self explanatory

cc_t: special character array with symbolic indices
    vmin: minimum nuber of characters necessary for non-canoncial read()
    vtime: timeout in dewciseconds for read()
